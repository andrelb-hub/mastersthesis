%	3. Descriptive Statistics

In this section, the data necessary to estimate the model parameters will be discussed using descriptive statistics. The intention is to demonstrate, through graphics and tables, a visual correspondence between the nominal interest rate and the gross domestic product of select Brazilian states, particularly those specialized in agriculture and industries. This emphasis aims to show that regional differences play an important role in how a region will react to monetary policy.
