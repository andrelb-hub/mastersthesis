### Abstract
### 1. Introduction
### 2. Model

small open-economy medium-sized DSGE model, similar to the models in [[Adolfson et al. (2007)]]

baseline version of [[Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin (2011)]] and [[Adolfson et al. (2013)]]

our foreign economy model closely resembles those in [[Smets and Wouters (2003)]], and [[Smets and Wouters (2007)]]

#### 2.1. firms

#### 2.2 households

We assume that there is a large representative household, with full risk sharing of consumption among household members as in [[Merz (1995)]].

The preferences with respect to consumption are specified as in [[Christiano, Trabandt, and Walentin (2011)]] and [[Adolfson et al. (2013)]].

The modelling of the disutility from work instead relies on the setup in[[ Galí (2011a)]] and [[Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012)]], with the purpose of introducing unemployment into the model in a simple way.

We include also an endogenous preference shifter as in [[Galí (2011a)]] and [[Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012)]]

With this definition, the unemployed include all the individuals who would like to work but are not currently employed. As argued in [[Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012)]], it can thus be viewed as involuntary.

As discussed by [[Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012)]] and [[Galí (2011a)]], this equation is inconsistent with the empirical evidence on the effects of a monetary policy shock based on US data since a policy shock which reduces the policy rate decreases {math expression} but increases the participation rate.

As in [[Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012)]], we define the natural rate of unemployment --- i.e. the unemployment rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal wage rigidities --- as {math expression}. 

They earn interest, Rt and Rt* on their domestic and foreign bond holdings, respectively, which is adjusted by a risk premium shock, xt, as in [[Smets and Wouters (2007)]].

We choose the unemployment rate as our measure of resource utilization following the reasoning in [[Adolfson et al. (2013)]] that, unlike the output gap, unemployment is an observed variable and judgments of it can thus directly affect monetary policy.

Following [[Adolfson et al. (2013)]] the policy rule incorporates the inflation trend shock, $\bar{\pi}_t^c$ , which was introduced in Section 2.1.1.

This specification of the real neutral rate is similar to its modelling in semi-structural models aimed to provide estimates of the neutral interest rate; see e.g. [[Laubach and Williams (2015)]], [[Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016)]] and [[Pescatori and Turunen (2015)]].

While [[Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016)]] assume that the real neutral rate contains a unit root, here it is assumed to be stationary and the steady-state values of the real interest rate trend and the actual real interest rate are assumed to be identical. Hence the steady states of the nominal neutral rate and the actual policy rates are equal, i.e. Rt = R.
