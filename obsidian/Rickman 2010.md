DSGE modeling began with work in real business cycle (RBC) analysis ([[Kydland and Prescott 1982]]; [[Long and Plosser 1983]]).

RBC models are underpinned by neoclassical general equilibrium economic theory ([[Kydland and Prescott 1991b]]).

Production typically is represented by a Cobb-Douglas function in RBC models, while utility is represented by constant relative risk aversion ([[DeJong and Dave 2007]], pp. 90â€“91).

The early models primarily relied on the method of calibration for parametrization. The Cobb-Douglas function could be calibrated using the long-run average labor share of output while a Cobb-Douglas utility function in terms of consumption versus leisure could be calibrated using the average fraction of time spent in nonleisure activity ([[Kydland and Prescott, 1991a]]).

[[Ingram, Kocherlakota, and Savin, 1994]] showed that for DSGE models to be nonsingular there must be as many shocks as there are endogenous observable variables.

Alternative procedures also have been developed to more formally parameterize DSGE models (Canova, 2007): full-information maximum likelihood estimation, generalized method of moments estimation, Bayesian estimation, and matching VAR and DSGE dynamic responses to structural shocks.

Work also continues on evaluating the validity of policy experiments in macroeconomic models, such as overcoming the Lucas critique for likely policies of interest (Kremer et al., 2006).

Del Negro and Schorfheide (2003, 2004) similarly find that out-of-sample forecasts based on a prior derived from a simple New Keynesian DSGE model outperform BVAR forecasts based on the Minnesota prior.

Del Negro and Schorfheide (2006) employed the DSGE-VAR framework to examine the extent of misspecification in DSGE models by finding out how much the DSGE restrictions had to be relaxed to fit U.S. macroeconomic data. They further investigate the extent to which New Keynesian frictions help the DSGE model fit the data.

Smets and Wouters (2003) find that the posterior odds and root-mean-squared forecast errors of a Bayesian-estimated New Keynesian DSGE model are close to those from the most accurate unrestricted VARs and Minnesota BVARs (based on lag length), in which the DSGE performs better than the least accurate VARs and BVARs.
